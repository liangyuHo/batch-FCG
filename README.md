# Usage
```
python main.py
cd model/
python detector.py --model [Model]

```
* There are KNN,LR,SVM,MLP,RF models, defult is SVM

# intro
* The file should be put in binary/
* When you run main.py, it will start preprocessing
* The feature will be stored in feature/feature.npy
* Move to model/
* run detector.py
